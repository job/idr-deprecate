                This document requests IANA to mark BGP path attribute
                values 30, 31, 129, 241, 242, and 243 as "deprecated".

            <t>
                It has been discovered that certain BGP Path Attribute values
                have been used in BGP implementations which have been deployed
                in the wild while not being assigned by the IANA for such
                usage. Unregistered usage of BGP Path Attribute values can lead to
                deployment problems for new technologies.
            </t>
            <t>
                The use of these unregistered values was noticed when BGP Large
                Communities attribute <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-large-community"/>
                was initially assigned value 30 by IANA. It was subsequently
                discovered that a widely-deployed <xref target="RFC4271">BGP-4</xref>
                implementation had released code which used path attribute 30
                and which applied a <xref target="RFC7606">"Treat-as-withdraw"</xref>
                strategy to routes containing a valid Large Community
                attribute, since it was expecting a different data structure.
                Because these routes were dropped, early adopters of Large
                Communities were unreachable from parts of the Internet. As a
                workaround, a new Early IANA Allocation was requested.
            </t>
            <t>
                The squatting of values 30, 31, 129, 241, 242 and 243 has been
                confirmed by the involved vendors or through source code
                review.

            <t>
                Per this document, IANA is requested to mark values 30, 31,
                129, 241, 242, and 243 as "deprecated" in the "BGP Path
                Attributes" registry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
                Parameters" group. The marking "deprecated" meaning "use is not
                recommended" (<xref target="I-D.leiba-cotton-iana-5226bis" />).

                There are no meaningful security consequences arising from this
