            <t>
                Network infrastructures have been increasingly hampered by DDoS
                attacks. In order to dampen the effects of these DDoS attacks,
                IP networks have offered BGP blackholing to neighboring
                networks via various mechanisms such as described in
                <xref target=" RFC3882" /> and <xref target="RFC5635" />.
            </t>

            <t>
                DDoS attacks targeting a certain IP address may cause
                congestion of links used to connect to other networks. In order
                to limit the impact of such a scenario on legitimate traffic,
                networks adopted a mechanism called BGP blackholing. A network
                that wants to trigger blackholing needs to understand the
                triggering mechanism adopted by its neighboring networks.
                Different networks provide different mechanisms to trigger
                blackholing, including but not limited to pre-defined blackhole
                next-hop IP addresses, specific BGP communities or via an
                out-of-band BGP session with a special BGP speaker.
            </t>

            <t>
                Having several different mechanisms to trigger blackholing in
                different networks makes it an unnecessarily complex,
                error-prone and cumbersome task for network operators.
                Therefore a well-known <xref target="RFC1997">BGP
                community</xref> is defined for operational ease.
            </t>

            <t>
                Having such a well-known BGP community for blackholing also
                supports networks because:
                <list style='symbols'>
                    <t> implementing and monitoring blackholing becomes easier
                        when implementation and operational guides do not cover
                        many options that trigger blackholing.
                    </t>
                    <t> the number of support requests from customers about how
                        to trigger blackholing in a particular neighboring
                        network will be reduced as the codepoint for common
                        blackholing mechanisms is unified.
                    </t>
                </list>
            </t>

            <t>
                Making it considerably easier for network operators to utilize
                blackholing makes operations easier.

                This document defines the use of a new well-known BGP transitive community,
                   BLACKHOLE.
               </t>

               <t>
                   The semantics of this attribute allow a network to interpret
                   the presence of this community as an advisory qualification to drop
                   any traffic being sent towards this prefix.

                <t>
                    When a network is under DDoS duress, it MAY announce an IP
                    prefix covering the victim's IP address(es) for the purpose
                    of signaling to neighboring networks that any traffic
                    destined for these IP address(es) should be discarded. In
                    such a scenario, the network operator SHOULD attach
                    BLACKHOLE BGP community.

                    A BGP speaker receiving a BGP announcement tagged with the
                    BLACKHOLE BGP community SHOULD add a NO_ADVERTISE,
                    NO_EXPORT or similar community to prevent propagation of
                    this route outside the local AS.
                </t>

                <t>
                    Unintentional leaking of more specific IP prefixes to
                    neighboring networks can have adverse effects. Extreme
                    caution should be used when purposefully propagating IP
                    prefixes tagged with the BLACKHOLE BGP community outside
                    the local routing domain.

                <t>
                    It has been observed that announcements of IP prefixes
                    larger than /24 for IPv4 and /48 for IPv6 are usually not
                    accepted on the Internet (see <xref
                        target="RFC7454">section 6.1.3</xref>). However,
                    blackhole routes should be as small as possible in order to
                    limit the impact of discarding traffic for adjacent IP
                    space that is not under DDoS duress.
                    Typically, the blackhole route's prefix length is as
                    specific as /32 for IPv4 and /128 for IPv6.
                </t>
                <t>
                    BGP speakers SHOULD only accept and honor BGP announcements
                    carrying the BLACKHOLE community if the announced prefix is
                    covered by a shorter prefix for which the neighboring
                    network is authorized to advertise.

                BGP contains no specific mechanism to prevent the unauthorized
                modification of information by the forwarding agent. This
                allows routing information to be modified, removed, or false
                information to be added by forwarding agents.  Recipients of
                routing information are not able to detect this modification.
                Also, <xref target="RFC6810">RPKI</xref> and
                <xref target="I-D.ietf-sidr-bgpsec-overview">BGPSec</xref> do
                not fully resolve this situation. For instance, BGP communities
                can still be added or altered by a forwarding agent even if
                RPKI and BGPSec are in place.
            </t>
            <t>
                The BLACKHOLE BGP community does not alter this situation.

            <t>
                A new additional attack vector is introduced into BGP by using
                the BLACKHOLE BGP community: denial of service attacks for IP
                prefixes.<!--Elaborate on the possible danger of -->

            <t>
                The unauthorized addition of the BLACKHOLE BGP community to an
                IP prefix by a forwarding agent may cause a denial of service
                attack based on denial of reachability. The denial of service
                will happen if a network offering blackholing is traversed.
                However, denial of service attack vectors to BGP are not new as
                the injection of false routing information is already possible.
            </t>

            <t>
                In order to further limit the impact of unauthorized BGP
                announcements carrying the BLACKHOLE BGP community, the
                receiving BGP speaker SHOULD verify by applying strict
                filtering (see <xref target="RFC7454">section 6.2.1.1.2.</xref>)
                that the peer announcing the prefix is authorized to do so. If
                not, the BGP announcement should be filtered out.
            </t>
            
            <t>
                The presence of this BLACKHOLE BGP community may introduce a
                resource exhaustion attack to BGP speakers. If a BGP speaker
                receives many IP prefixes containing the BLACKHOLE BGP
                community, its internal resources such as CPU power, memory or
                FIB capacity might exhaust, especially if usual prefix sanity
                checks (e.g. such as IP prefix length or number of prefixes)
                are disabled (see <xref target="small" />).
